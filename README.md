# Work-Day-Scheduler
Work Day Scheduler using 3rd party libraries

## Description

This application was created to keep track of the tasks that are necessary to do throughout my workday. A visible schedule is great for staying on task and ensuring everything is completed in a timely manner. When in the workplace, you can potentially find that you are overwhelmed with tasks that things you need to completed by the end of your business day, using the scheduler to plan your day makes it much more manageable. Throughout this project, I learned how to integrate 3rd party libraries such as bootstrap, Day.js and jQuery. The 3 libraries have become very useful tools when it comes to web applications and has made aspects of coding easier to complete.
